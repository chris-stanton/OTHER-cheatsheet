## Node Install

1. First you need to get brew. You can test if you have brew with this command:

	```
	$: which brew
	> /usr/local/bin/brew
	```
If you don't have it follow the install instructions on the [brew site](http://brew.sh/). You will need to run a run command in your terminal. Come find an instructor if you have permissions issues.
2. Install node with brew using the following command:

	```
	$: brew install node
	```
It will think for awhile, but once it is done you should be able to test you have node with the `which node` command just as we did with brew above.

##### Note
	You many encounter permissions issues when installing packages with brew.

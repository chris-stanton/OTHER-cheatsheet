## pSQL Install

First update brew before installing anything new. In terminal type:

```
brew update
```

Then use brew to install postgres:

```
brew install postgres
```

Start the postgres database server using: 

```
brew services start postgresql
```
Create your first database named after your user with the following command:

```
createdb $USER
```

Test that your install worked by entering the psql shell:

```
psql
```

The above command will change your prompt to have a `#` in it. This just indicates you are inside the psql shell meaning you can interact with your databases.

To exit the psql shell type:

```
\q 
```

## Install Postico

You can download it here: [https://eggerapps.at/postico/](https://eggerapps.at/postico/)

Or via brew in the terminal:

```
brew install postico
```

Once you install it, open it and click `connect`. This will create a connection to your postgres database server, so you can interact with postgres via postico.
